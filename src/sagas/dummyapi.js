A couple of strong storm systems interacting with an atmospheric river with origins near Hawaii are forecast to bring periods of moderate to heavy rain to the San Francisco Bay Area and Central Coast region tonight through Thursday. Recent precipitation through early February has already resulted in saturated soils across the district. Additional heavy rainfall will likely increase the risk for rapid rises of creaks, streams and rivers on Wednesday and Thursday. Steady rain is forecast to begin in the North Bay this afternoon and become heavier this evening. Rains will spread south through the San Francisco Bay Area and Central Coast area by Wednesday morning. Rainfall rates of at least half an inch per hour are possible during the heaviest showers, with the highest rates in the higher terrain. Additional rainfall is anticipated Wednesday night into Thursday morning as another impulse moves through. Rainfall estimates from tonight through Thursday give 1.00 to 2.00 inches to most urban areas and inland valleys, except the North Bay Valleys, which could receive from 3.00 to 4.00 inches. Coastal ranges are expected to receive between 4.00 and 6.00 inches with locally higher amounts possible. Mainstem rivers, from the Russian and Napa Rivers in the North Bay to the Carmel and Big Sur Rivers farther south, are forecast to see significant and rapid rises beginning on Wednesday and peak on Thursday and Friday. As of Tuesday morning, projections for our mainstem river forecast points indicate only the Russian River at Guernville exceeding flood stage of 32 feet Friday morning. A few other forecast points are forecast to exceed monitor stage. These include the Napa River at Saint Helena and the Napa River at Napa, also the Pajaro River at Chittenden. Although these are the only sites currently forecast to meet or exceed these levels, changes in rainfall amounts received could result in these or other sites approaching or even exceeding monitor or flood stage. Smaller rivers and streams could flood, especially if heavy rain rates persist across a particular watershed. Flooding is most likely in the more typically flood prone low- lying areas. In addition, heavy rain rates over the North Bay burn scars could potentially trigger flash flooding or mudslide/debris flows. Away from the burn scars, shallow landsliding could also be a concern if precipitation rates and intensities are sufficient. Latest data from USGS research instrumentation in the San Francisco Bay Area indicates that shallow soils on steep hill slopes are at or near saturation. Cooler, showery weather is expected Friday and Saturday with drier weather by next week. Persons living near rivers and streams or other flood prone areas should be alert for the possibility of flooding during this event. Please stay tuned to bulletins from NWS, NWS social media (@NWSBayArea), or from other sources of local weather information.\n","uri":"https://alerts.weather.gov/cap/wwacapget.php?x=CA125CE66D0380.HydrologicOutlook.125CE67C5880CA.MTRESFMTR.8cc97ea8069afd3c77676120abac4b73"}],"flags":{"sources":["nearest-precip","nwspa","cmc","gfs","hrrr","icon","isd","madis","nam","sref","darksky"],"nearest-station":1.839,"units":"us"},"offset":-8},
